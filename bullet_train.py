# "From Newton's second law, it can be shown that work on a free (no fields), rigid (no internal degrees of freedom) body, is equal to the change in kinetic energy Ek corresponding to the linear velocity and angular velocity of that body" - wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)#Work_and_energy
# Since this is the case for our train, as well as since we have no angular component, our total work is simply equal to total change in kinetic energy.
# Kinetic energy calculated as 1/2 m*v^2.
